                <p class=""> Iâ€™m a hard woking front end developer based in london UK.
                  <br> I decided to change my profession in October 2015, and dive into IT world as it is my favourite field.
                  <br> it was a challenge for me to catch up with a lot of things in a very short time as i wasn`t graduated from any computer science colleage, add to this that the world is updating every day, however I bravely started to study online courses
                  and found that I actually love programming! <br>
				          I decided to take the next step in web development and studied HTML, CSS, JS and some other technologies.
                </p>

              <div class="well">
  				        <p> By studying hard for long hours, joining courses after others, submitting assignments, meeting up with other developers, searching and reading I become confident enough to start my new career as a web developer.
                    I work voluntarily with imax-design.com and keep my self engaged with new courses and projects all the time.
