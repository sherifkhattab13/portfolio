          <p class=""> Iâ€™m a hard woking front end developer based in london UK.<br>
            I am specialising in JavaScript, responsive design, animation. I am fascinated with front-end technologies and possibilities of HTML5 / CSS3 / Javascript.<br>
            The large scope of my work is front end: coding layouts, single page apps (MVC, MVVM),
            Angular JS + Node JS, animation CSS / JS. But some times I get my hands dirty with some back end applications written in nodeJs / ExpressJs.

          <p> I decided to change my profession in October 2015, and dive into IT world as it is my favourite field.
            <br> it was a challenge for me to catch up with a lot of things in a very short time as i wasn`t graduated from any computer science colleage, add to this that the world is updating every day, however I bravely started to study online courses and
            found that I actually love programming! I decided to take the next step in web development and studied HTML, CSS, JS and some other technologies. By studying hard for long hours, joining courses after others, submitting assignments, meeting
            up with other developers, searching and reading I become confident enough to start my new career as a web developer. At the moment along with my continous study I work voluntarily with imax-design.com and keep my self engaged with new courses
            and projects all the time.
